# Bowl Party
This is a small VR game I've been working on for a few months. You can bowl, and that's about it. 

It's made in Unity Engine using the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit, and I'm hoping it's not too much of a pain to set up when cloning the repo.

Maybe I'll update this, maybe I won't, although I think I would like to continue it at some point.

In the meantime I've made it open source so people can try to make their own maps.

If you just want to download the game, check it out [here](https://glotchalotch.itch.io/bowl-party).
